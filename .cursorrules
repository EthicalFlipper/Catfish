# Catfish Project Rules

## Project Context
Building a Chrome extension + FastAPI backend for dating app catfish detection.
No dating app API integrations - users provide inputs manually.

## Structure
- apps/extension/ = Chrome MV3 extension (React + TS + Vite)
- apps/api/ = FastAPI backend (Python 3.11+)

## Extension Guidelines
- Use React functional components with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Use chrome.* APIs for extension features
- Side panel is the main UI surface
- Service worker handles background tasks

## API Guidelines
- FastAPI with Pydantic models
- Async endpoints preferred
- CORS must allow chrome-extension://*
- Use settings.py for env config

## Code Style
- Extension: TypeScript, React best practices
- API: Python 3.11+, type hints, async/await
- Keep files focused and small
- Document complex logic

## Current Focus
MVP scaffolding complete. Next: implement tabCapture recording.
